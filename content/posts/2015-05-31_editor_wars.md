Summary: Emacs vs. Vim vs. IntelliJ vs. a potato-battery-powered mechanical goat stenographer
Status: draft

I'm an emacs user; have been for something like three-quarters of my
career.[^1] I get a lot of pleasure out of it -- even when it makes me mad,
emacs is my favorite pair of boots. I know I can get real work done in emacs,
and I like the feeling of being Dressed for Work.

I've been thinking, I confess, a lot about emacs recently -- and specifically
how much happiness it brings me. It comes up for me in part because emacs is,
well... fickle. Unless you're very careful about how you manage your
configuration[^2], emacs breaks. It's the Millennium Falcon of text editors,
complete with with a
[weirdo mysoginist captain](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/EMACS_virgins_joke).[^3] Emacs
drops out of hyperspeed at odd and jarring moments, dropping you from
ready-at-hand to present-at-hand for reasons which can be... challenging to
diagnose.

The other thing that keeps me thinking about the answer to "why emacs" is the
[editor wars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war),[^5] in which grown-ass
adults cannot find anything better to do than mock each others choice of
tools. I get asked "why emacs" a lot, or just teased about it. 

And yet, for all but two things, I still wont use anything else.

Thing one is Java; so is thing two.[^4] I'm pretty confident that without IntelliJ,
my career as a Java developer would be downright Hobbsian. The astonishing
static-analysis wizards at JetBrains HQ have made something precious and
dazzling: an IDE that understands the (pretty goddamn complecated) stucture and
needs of your Java code _without the benefit of any kind of interpreter or
server._ Srsly: that's jaw-droppingly cool. Also very cool: they're slowly
turning what they've made in to an IDE _backend_, so that anyone who wants to
can make a language-specific _frontend_ to use their wicked-cool code.

Except.

Except...

...except that I don't want it. I write both Python and Clojure and use neither
PyCharm nor Cursive. I've chewed a lot on this question of _why_? Why one and
not the other? Why not Vim? Why not a different editor for every language I
write?

Backing up for just a moment, there's one last reason I've been thinking about
this: people who are new to coding get made fun of all the time -- maybe for
using Notepad or Sublime, maybe for having a windows machine, maybe for not
knowing what `grep` is. Or hell -- maybe it's not even new coders. Maybe it's
people who data analysis in Excel being dumped on by "real data scientists", or
data scientists being dumped on by "real engineers". Or programmers of Language
A who can't _believe_ you'd write Language B.

Somewhere in tech we lost our ability to feel comfortable with our choices, but
technology inherently prods us to do our Own Thing. Use Dvorak! Make your own
terminal commands! Colorize and tweak and poke! Thing is, we can't norm each
other in the same atrocious way we do gender and sexuality

I am on to something here, but I cant quite tease it apart. Keep.... pondering. 

Editors, languages, norming. 


[^1]: So, y'know. Three of my four years on the beat. 

[^2]: Which is to say, you _pretty much never change it or update anything ev4r OMG_.

[^3]: And now, a bracing round of Who are you More Upset I Called a Mysoginist:
    Stallman vs: Han Solo edition.

[^4]: Okay, thing two is more generic than Java: re-factoring Java _or_ Scala
    Maven projects into multi-module projects. IntelliJ? Indispensible for
    that. But: I don't write Scala with IntelliJ. I use Emacs. 

[^5]: Yes, that's right, the weirdo mysoginist captain is sometimes dressed as a
    priest.
